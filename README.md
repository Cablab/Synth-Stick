# SynthStick-Caleb.ino
I have no idea if this is going to compile because I wrote it on a text editor at work, but I took a stab at fixing the machine gun firing of notes that we were experiencing. Here are the changes I made in the SynthStick-Caleb.ino file:

- I divided our SoftPot into 15 sections and set the notes to play a Major scale from E to the E two octaves up.
- I made an enum for the "fret" that is currently being played.
- I made a variable to store what "fret" was played before and a variable for the current "fret"
- I made a function that sets the enum variables to their correct values
- Before entering the if else of notes to play, the program now checks to see if the current note to play is the same as the note played previously. If it is, the if else of notes to play is skipped

# SynthStick-Caleb-v2.ino
Still unsure if it'll compile/is syntactically correct, but... More changes implemented:

- Hard coded the Major, Major Pentatonic, and Minor Pentatonic (with b5) scales into separate arrays
- Created a currentScale array to hold the current array scale values
- Created a method changeScale that should change scale arrays when it's called. Use for a button toggle or something

# SynthStick-v3.ino
I got the code compiling for using the memcpy on arrays. It just had to be done in the setup() function instead of out in the global sphere where we were declaring it. Changes:

- Added a button for instrument down
- Added a button to change scales
- Added functions for changing instrument up, changing instrument down, and changing scale
- Now using arrays and memcpy to change scale and play the correct note

# SynthStick-v4.ino
The code is still compiling, so that's a good sign. Here are a list of the changes I made with this version:

- Added a button for changing key
- Added functions to update a given scale's keys
- Added a function to change key being played

# SynthStick_v4_LCD.ino
Version 4 with the addition of an LCD screen

- Screen displays relevant information
- Screen updates each loop in case anything changed

# SynthStick-v4-LCD_pointers.ino
Well, looks like I broke something somewhere in v3 or v4. This is the first file with changes that we think will help with debugging. New changes:

- Now using a pointer to the current scale instead of a separate array that we memcpy with the current array. Seems obvious
- Took out the #include <string.h> since we don't need it anymore
