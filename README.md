# Working-SynthStick

Our project has been tested and is currently working, so all previous file versions have been removed at this point for clean up purposes. Here are the changes made from v4-LCD-pointers:

- Remapped keyBPin to 9 since 4 doubles as a reset and was giving us issues
- Refactored code that checks for button presses into separate function
